    <h1>Course Summary</h1>


    <p id="p1">These are the topic we've learnt during our time at this course:</p>
    <h1>Anthony's contribution</h1>
    <h2>Intro to CSS:</h2>

    <p id="p2">We started by identifying what CSS was, its a W3C standard for describing the apperance of HTML elements.
        CSS is like the decoration of your webpage, it beautifies the webpage. 
    </p>
    <p id="p2">After that we look at the syntax of the CSS. Here we found out that a CSS document consists of one or more style rules. And that a rule consists of a <b>selector</b> that identifies the Html element/s that will be affected, then followed by a series of <b>Property-value</b> pairs(each pair is called a declaration).  
    </p>
    <p id="p2">Folowing that was the locations of the CSS code where we learnt that there are three locations: inline, Internal and External.
        <p id="p2" > Inline: Here the CSS is placed within an Html element via the style attribute. </p>
        <p id="p2"> Internal(Embedded): Here the CSS is placed within the <b>style</b> element that is inside the head element of the HTML document  </p>
        <p id="p2"> External: Here the style rules are placed within an eternal text file with the .css extention.</p>

    <h3>Tables And Forms:</h3>
    <p>
        
<h2>Forms and Tables in Web Development</h2>

<h3>Forms:</h3>
<p>Forms are used to collect data from users. They typically consist of input fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, dropdown menus, and submit buttons. Forms can be used for various purposes such as user registration, contact forms, surveys, and more. When designing forms, it's crucial to consider usability, accessibility, and validation.</p>

<p>HTML provides a set of form elements that can be used to create forms. These elements include &lt;form&gt;, &lt;input&gt;, &lt;select&gt;, &lt;textarea&gt;, and &lt;button&gt;. The &lt;form&gt; element acts as a container for all the form elements, while the &lt;input&gt; element is used for text inputs, checkboxes, radio buttons, and more. The &lt;select&gt; element is used for dropdown menus, and the &lt;textarea&gt; element is used for multiline text inputs. The &lt;button&gt; element is used to create submit buttons.</p>

<p>To ensure data integrity and accuracy, form validation is essential. JavaScript can be used to validate user inputs, such as checking for required fields, validating email addresses, or enforcing character limits. Additionally, server-side validation should be implemented to validate data on the backend and prevent malicious or incorrect data from being processed.</p>

<h3>Tables:</h3>
<p>Tables are used to organize and present data in a tabular format. They consist of rows and columns, with each cell containing data. Tables are commonly used for displaying data like pricing plans, product listings, financial data, and more. When designing tables, it's important to consider readability, responsiveness, and accessibility.</p>

<p>HTML provides the &lt;table&gt; element for creating tables. The table structure consists of the &lt;table&gt; element, which contains one or more &lt;tr&gt; elements (table rows). Each &lt;tr&gt; element contains one or more &lt;td&gt; elements (table cells) or &lt;th&gt; elements (table headers). The &lt;td&gt; elements represent regular data cells, while the &lt;th&gt; elements represent header cells.</p>

<p>CSS can be used to style tables, including setting background colors, borders, font styles, and alignment. Additionally, CSS frameworks like Bootstrap provide pre-styled table components that can be easily customized to fit the design of your website.</p>

<p>Tables can also be enhanced with features like sorting, filtering, and pagination to improve the user experience. JavaScript libraries and frameworks like DataTables, React Table, and Vue.js can be used to implement these functionalities.</p>

<p>In conclusion, forms and tables play a crucial role in web development. They allow users to input data and display information in a structured manner. By following best practices, considering usability and accessibility, and implementing validation and styling techniques, you can create effective and user-friendly forms and tables for your web applications.</p>

    <h2>INTRODUCTION TO HTML</h2>
    <h1>HTML: The Standard Markup Language for Web Pages</h1>
    <p>HTML, short for Hypertext Markup Language, is the standard markup language used for creating web pages. It provides the structure and content of a webpage by using a series of HTML elements or tags. These tags define the different parts of a webpage such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, tables, and more.</p>
    <p>HTML uses a hierarchical structure, where elements are nested within each other to create the desired layout and organization of content on a webpage. Each HTML element is represented by a pair of opening and closing tags, with the content placed between them.</p>
    <p>For example, to create a heading in HTML, you would use the &lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt; tags, with the desired heading text placed between them. Similarly, to create a paragraph, you would use the &lt;p&gt; tags, with the paragraph text placed between them.</p>
    <p>HTML also allows you to add attributes to elements, which provide additional information or functionality to the elements. Attributes are specified within the opening tag of an element and typically consist of a name-value pair.</p>
    <p>To view the HTML code in action, you can simply open the HTML file in a web browser, and the browser will interpret the HTML code and display the webpage accordingly.</p>
    <p>HTML is the foundation of web development and is essential for creating any web page. It is a relatively easy language to learn and is a great starting point for anyone interested in web development.</p>
